Project title: **Gilhari Simplifying Transfer of Data from One RDBMS TO Another RDBMS (Of Different Kind) Using AWS**

```gilhari5_mysql_populate_local.config``` is the config file that allows populating a MySQL database with 50 objects, using the ```curlPopulate.cmd``` command file.

In order to run the files, install the ```Gilhari SDK``` (available at [www.softwaretree.com](https://www.softwaretree.com/)). Follow the installation instructions. 
Create ```.jdx``` and ```.class``` files in the required directories as needed. Update JDBC driver installed for the corresponding database versions on your system, and reference them appropriately in ```.jdx``` and ```.config``` files.
